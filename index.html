    <h2>Nature, in the broadest sense, is the natural, physical, material world or universe.</h2>
    <p> "Nature" can refer to the phenomena of the physical world, and also to life in general. The study of nature is a large, if not the only, part of science. Although humans are part of nature, human activity is often understood as a separate category from other natural phenomena.</p>
